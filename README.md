=======

Most of these from [@mattt](https://github.com/mattt)'s [Xcode Snippets](https://github.com/mattt/Xcode-Snippets). Feel free to poke around, you can fork and import these to your own.

Snippet management plugin used is [ACCodeSnippetRepositoryPlugin](https://github.com/acoomans/ACCodeSnippetRepositoryPlugin). You can install it via [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io) :rocket:

Thanks!
